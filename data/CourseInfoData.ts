The course will first introduce students to the concepts of privacy, the digital age, and the relation between privacy protections and the state. Students will understand the significance of the issue of digital privacies and why we need to employ a comparative approach to examine it.  The course will then look at selected case studies of digital privacy in several global regions, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and South East Asia. Issues related to digital privacies such as Internet laws and policies, media regulations and public interest, data protection, state control, and commercial interests in the digital age, surveillance, copyright, and privacy advocates will also be included.",

The course is organized into units focusing on different methods of automating writing: mechanical; spiritual; procedural; statistical; simulative. Each unit teaches students historical and technical contexts of its associated automation through texts and hands-on projects. Students who take this class will learn to generate text using computational processes and critically examine the text they produce. In so doing, students will engage with the political and ethical implications of large-scale data usage to train machine learning algorithms, including issues of underrepresented languages, bias, hate speech, further marginalizing communities, automating labor, environmental impacts, dirty data, and privacy violations. As we trace the development and commercialization of NLG, we'll consider whose writing is being automated, and for what purposes.",

Data literacy is thus important and in this first introductory course we will focus on shifting the traditional mode of deterministic (yes/no) thinking to probabilistic thinking. In this course, we will review concepts from applied probability and statistics and explore how they can be used in building a data-driven infrastructure with applications ranging from understanding a variety of everyday phenomena (e.g., descriptive modeling) to making decisions based on data (e.g., predictive modeling). In particular, we will focus on the principles and best practices in dealing with data, including understanding (a) the bias-variance tradeoff, (b) how to avoid overfitting, (c) how to choose the most appropriate model for your data and (d) how to evaluate your model's performance.   While the main focus of the course is on supervised learning, we will also introduce unsupervised learning and in particular the problem of clustering. We will also explore the concept of Monte Carlo simulations and resampling, and how they can be used to make predictions for systems that are too complicated to be solved in closed form. We will also provide an overview of analytical methods for specialized form of data including time series and relational data.",

In this course, we will interrogate the work of data scientists through a social justice lens and develop a personal statement that articulates responsible data science. Responsible data practices cut across the lifecycle of a dataset, and a responsible data scientist will ask questions about the decisions and people behind the data collection, people represented or ignored in the dataset, and the people impacted by tools and algorithms that use the data. In this course, we will engage with social justice, policy, and people-oriented dimensions of data work. Each module will introduce a case study or vignette that illustrates these dimensions across different aspects of data work. Through these modules, we will develop cognitive approaches for examining data, our positionality, and the implications of data collection, analysis, and algorithms on communities.',

This course is hands-on and demonstrates the key concepts and skills through numerous programming examples in lectures, homework assignments, and projects. The course begins by reviewing probability distributions with a special emphasis on how distributions communicate uncertainty. The Bayesian "mindset" is introduced by showing how probability distributions allow subjective information to be used in modeling tasks via Prior distributions. Students will be shown the connection between Bayesian Priors and Non-Bayesian regularization/penalization methods which they have been introduced to in previous courses. From there, students are taught how to properly train, validate, and communicate the Bayesian modeling results for linear, generalized linear models, and multi-level (hierarchical) models using popular open-source libraries. Special emphasis is made to diagnose the Bayesian inference procedure to ensure the models are adequate and trustworthy.',

The course will explore the implications of using quantum mechanics, instead of classical mechanics, to model information and computing. Quantum computing is not about changing the physical substrate on which computation is done from classical to quantum, but rather changing the notion of computation itself. The change starts at the most basic level: the fundamental unit of computation is no longer the bit, but rather the quantum bit, or qubit. Placing computation on a quantum mechanical foundation led to the discovery of faster algorithms, novel cryptographic mechanisms, and improved communication protocols.  The course will start with the basic building blocks of quantum information processing: quantum bits and quantum gates. The course will cover common elements of quantum computation and include discussion of concepts of computational complexity. We will also discuss known bounds on the power of classical, randomized, and quantum computation. Finally, the course will explore entanglement and robust quantum computation. We will extensively cover the elegant and important topic of quantum error correction, and techniques to achieve fault tolerance.",

Although at times such sharing can be intentional and beneficial for the user, other times information is shared against the user's will, used for purposes that the user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to infer additional information that the user did not intend to reveal. In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing. Finally, students will learn about several privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and how these can be put to use by software developers to defend the privacy of their users.",

The development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world. At the same time, these intelligent models may incorporate existing biases or create new biases that can seriously harm society. At its worst, AI can exacerbate misguided old practices and aggravate past social harms with its unprecedented processing powers and the veneer of seemingly objectivity, as humans in various social factions are disparately impacted by the AI-aided decisions.  Facing the ethical implications of AI, students need to be prepared with the critical intellectual capacities that allow them to understand and deal with these ethical challenges. These capacities comprise multi-disciplinary concepts ranging from statistical learning theories, model design, and ethical foundation, to psychological and cultural frameworks that are necessary for successfully navigating and evaluating responsible AI practices. Further, "ethical competence" will involve understanding various challenges surrounding AI, such as ethical regulation, fairness assessment, and interpretability of models. Note that this is a technical class. Our focus will be on designing, evaluating, and mitigating bias in machine learning models. You will have three programming assignments in Python.',

In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing.

        'Artificial intelligence holds tremendous promise to benefit nearly all aspects of society, including healthcare, food production, economy, education, security, the law, and even our personal activities. The development of AI is creating new opportunities to improve the lives of people around the world. At the same time, these intelligent models may incorporate existing biases or create new biases that can seriously harm society. At its worst, AI can exacerbate misguided old practices and aggravate past social harms with its unprecedented processing powers and the veneer of seemingly objectivity, as humans in various social factions are disparately impacted by the AI-aided decisions.  Facing the ethical implications of AI, students need to be prepared with the critical intellectual capacities that allow them to understand and deal with these ethical challenges. These capacities comprise multi-disciplinary concepts ranging from statistical learning theories, model design, and ethical foundation, to psychological and cultural frameworks that are necessary for successfully navigating and evaluating responsible AI practices. Further, "ethical competence" will involve understanding various challenges surrounding AI, such as ethical regulation, fairness assessment, and interpretability of models. Note that this is a technical class. Our focus will be on designing, evaluating, and mitigating bias in machine learning models. You will have three programming assignments in Python.',

      description:
        'The 2010 National Educational Technology Plan outlined how "The challenge for our education system is to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners." While instruction has traditionally been one-size-fits-all, the rise of web-based and mobile technologies provide an opportunity to automatically detect what learners need and adapt instruction to their unique prior knowledge, motivation, and preferences. In this seminar course, we survey different types of personalization in educational technologies (e.g., cognitive, metacognitive, social, motivational), computational modeling techniques for representing learners and their needs, and best practices in designing personalized supports for learners. Students will lead one or more class discussions, participate in the other discussions, and complete a group course project.   Students must have a foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures before enrolling in this course.',
