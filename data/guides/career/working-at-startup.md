## 1. What is a startup?

A startup can be anything from a group of friends making a website for their local community to a large AI tech company valued at billions of dollars.

To put it simply:
> A startup is a young company, often with a tech-based, innovative idea, that is in the process of being developed to scale quickly and disrupt an industry.

## 2. Pros of a startup

### General Pros

<details>
<summary><strong>Rapid Learning</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Startups are very fast paced, to the extent where you might be working on something entirely different every two weeks. You might build an API from scratch and then build the mobile app screen that actually calls it next. Outside of technical projects, you have less barriers to learn other disciplines, like social media, recruiting, or trust and safety if you express interest in these different areas of work.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>High Ownership</strong></summary>
<ul><li>You will be expected to own certain features or systems, which means you will have to build, maintain, and answer questions about these systems that sometimes take entire teams in larger companies. This quickly builds initiative and leadership skills, which can sometimes be hard to get early in your career.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Learn How a Company Operates</strong></summary>
<ul><li>At a startup, higher ups are usually one or two links away. You can see how executives operate on a day to day basis while also seeing other processes like legal/recruiting/marketing all at the same time. It's hard to describe, but its like drinking company concentrate, instead of a regular soup. The bureaucracy of a larger company is not there, and so you might need to learn company procedures that you would otherwise be sheltered from at a larger company.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>San Francisco</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Startups, especially AI startups, are likely located in San Francisco. SF is the tech capital of the world and that opens a lot of opportunities. For example, because there are so many tech employees and networking events with companies like Google, OpenAI, and YC, job opportunities are generally easier to find in SF (once already in SF).
<li>SF is also super bikable, the Caltrain is really nice (during the day), and there is access to a lot of park space.
<li>SF is near a lot of national parks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Compensation</strong></summary>
<ul><li>The compensation is usually very competitive depending on what stage that the startup is at. Good series A, B, or C startups can definitely pay as much as big tech, if not more. Startups usually give out options rather than stock in the company, which usually has a higher risk and higher reward than an already IPO'd company.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Networking</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Within your startup, you are mostly friends with all your coworkers. Usually startups attract more younger talent, so it is not uncommon to go out with your team. This is also the case for some big tech teams though (and almost every other company).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Prestige</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Good startups are arguably harder to get into than big tech. The prestige that comes with working at a good startup could help set you apart in a networking event or get funding later on if you want to found yourself.
</details>

### Intern specific

<details>
<summary><strong>Treated as a real employee</strong></summary>
<ul><li>As an intern at a startup, your work is genuinely needed. Once you get onboarded, you will also be expected to build, own, and maintain code/systems that you create.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Random Benefits</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Because you are basically a full time, real employee, you might be able to have some fun adventures at the expense of your startup. For example, using the company card to go to a convention or getting a DoorDash or wellness benefit that the full time employees also have.
</details>

### Full time specific

<details>
<summary><strong>Expressing Company Direction</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Startups generally have more freedom to express your own ideas and turn them into a reality. As a full time employee, if you have the bandwidth to make something on top of your regular work, you could pitch, develop, and give birth to something entirely new that you came up with.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Title Inflation</strong></summary>
<ul><li>You might have the same title as someone who would be 5 levels higher than you at a big tech company. This is something small but could be something cool.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Fun Events</strong></summary>
<ul><li>There is generally a "work hard, play hard" mentality. It can be lit.
</details>

## 3. Cons of a startup

### General Cons

<details>
<summary><strong>Work Life Balance</strong></summary>
<ul><li>It's no secret that people who work at startups work a lot. This can be a slippery slope sometimes. If you are someone who struggles with work life balance, or is scared about not having one at a startup, I would suggest trying to plan out some boundaries of time that work can absolutely not creep into.
</details>

### Intern Specific

<details>
<summary><strong>Junior Year Internship</strong></summary>
<ul><li>If its your junior year internship, it might be harder to get a full time big tech job if you decide you don't like startups and you're not coming from a big tech background. Key words: <b>it might be</b>. It's definitely doable.
</details>

### Full Time Specific

<details>
<summary><strong>Less Job Security</strong></summary>
<ul><li>The existence of your job might depend on how well you do. Sometimes, startups don't even know if they're going to be around in a few months.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Higher Risk Equity</strong></summary>
<ul><li>Your options/equity in a startup could be worth nothing in the long run if the company never exits or has a liquidation event. It's high risk, high reward.
</details>

## 4. Startup vs big tech

### At a glance

| Startup | Big Tech |
|---------|----------|
| ✅ Flat org structure | ❌ Layers of management |
| ✅ High ownership of features/systems | ❌ Narrow scope, specialized roles |
| ✅ Minimal bureaucracy | ❌ More processes and approvals |
| ✅ High degree of freedom | ❌ More structured guidelines |
| ✅ Greater individual influence | ❌ Harder to make impact |
| ⚠️ More work expected | ✅ More defined scope |
| ⚠️ Less work-life balance | ✅ Better work-life balance |

Note: this table is generalizing, there will always be exceptions.

### Which one is for you?

Honestly, there is no bad choice and the grass will look greener on the other side regardless. Big Tech workers might want to join a startup for the higher impact work, higher ownership, and less bureaucracy. Startup workers might want the better work life balance, more certain career path, and guaranteed prestige. It also depends heavily on the companies.

## 5. Getting into startups

### Networking

In life it's not about what you know, its about *who* you know. This applies even more with startups. If you have a good rep with one of the engineers or even the CEO, a referral at a startup can go a long way, especially if the startup only hires on referral basis.

### Other tactics

<details>
<summary><strong>Cold Emails</strong></summary>
<ul><li>I met a few vercel interns over the Summer of 2026 and all of them said that they got their internship through a cold email or Twitter DM. Cold emailing startup founders shows that you are hungry and driven. It will give a good chance of getting eyes on your resume if you word it correctly.
<li>Some tips on cold emailing:
<ul>
<li>Come across as genuine
<li>Keep your emails short
<li>Don't ask for a referral, ask for a quick chat
<li>Summarize your key background experience and why you're interested in their startup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>YC</strong></summary>
<ul><li>You can apply to intern at YC companies <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/internships">here</a>.

## 6. Starting your own startup

It's not about the idea... well it is... but its mainly how many times you can try an idea, fail, then try again.

### Should I found?

Honestly, no one but yourself should be able to answer that question. Founding is an arduous journey and even successful founders make many sacrifices (relationships, time, physical health) to become successful. It could be super rewarding.

Founding has the highest risk, but the highest reward (in terms of money)

![Risk Reward of Founding, Startups, and Big Tech](https://i.ibb.co/rGkvT1Lz/Reward-Potential.pngz)

### Who do I found with?

Roommates are a good option. Anyone that you like generally and can work with. A good way to figure out if you can work with someone is to do a Hackathon with them.

Beware of founder breakups though. Founding can put a lot of stress on the relationship between co-founders, and it is not uncommon for founders to "break up" and ruin the actual relationship between the once previous friends.

### How do I start?

In the same vein of making a personal project, you need to try and make something that solves a problem, usually a problem that you experience in your own life.

You can figure out if other people experience the same problem by creating a waitlist and seeing how much traction that gets.

Once you build your MVP and gain some traction, you can start applying for funding.

## 7. Funding

I am going to be completely honest, this is outside of my expertise. Funding is not an easy task. Usually, founders in accelerate programs like YC have easier times funding.

There are caveats with funding, such as where the venture capitalist is located. Generally, you want to find one that is located in SF, as you might be restricted to the location where your VC is.

Also, consider the fact that you might not need VC money to operate your company. If your product is gaining revenue and you can reinvest that back into the product, that could help it grow.

There's a saying that VC money is rocket fuel. When you have VC money, they expect you to spend it to grow your company and beat out the competition.

## 8. Startup lingo

<details>
<summary><strong>Seed Round, Pre-Seed Round</strong></summary>

**Pre-Seed:** The earliest stage of funding, often from founders' own money, friends and family, or angel investors. Companies typically raise $50k-$500k to validate their idea and build an MVP.

**Seed Round:** The first official round of venture funding, usually $500k-$3M, used to prove product-market fit and achieve initial growth. Companies typically have a working product and some early users/revenue.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Series A, B, C...</strong></summary>

Series A is the first major round of institutional venture capital funding (typically $2M-$15M) after seed funding. Series B, C, D, etc. represent subsequent funding rounds as the company grows and scales. Each round typically involves raising more money at a higher valuation as the company hits key milestones.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Options (Stock Options)</strong></summary>

Stock options give employees the right to buy company shares at a fixed price (the "strike price"). If the company's value increases, you can buy shares at the old lower price and potentially profit. Options typically vest over 4 years with a 1-year cliff, meaning you need to stay at least a year to get any, then earn them gradually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Burn Rate</strong></summary>

Burn rate is how much money your startup is spending (losing) per month, usually measured as monthly expenses minus revenue. For example, if you spend $100k/month and make $20k in revenue, your burn rate is $80k/month. You're typically "burning" VC money to grow faster than revenue alone would allow.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Runway</strong></summary>

Runway is how many months your startup can operate before running out of money at your current burn rate. For example, with $1M in the bank and $100k/month burn, you have 10 months of runway.
