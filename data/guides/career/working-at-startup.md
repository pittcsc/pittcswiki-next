## 1. What is a startup?

A startup can be anything from a group of friends making a website for their local community to a large AI tech company valued at billions of dollars.

To put it simply:
> A startup is a young company, often with a tech-based, innovative idea, that is in the process of being developed to scale quickly and disrupt an industry.

## 2. Pros of a startup

TODO: Make these charts?

As both an intern and a full time employee:

* At a startup, you will learn **a lot**. Since it's so fast paced, you might be working on something different every two weeks. Touching so many different areas casts a wide range of learning. You are of course able to express interest in different areas of work you want to pick up.

* At a startup, there is much higher ownership. You will be expected to own certain features or systems, which means you will have to build, maintain, and answer questions about these systems that sometimes take entire teams in larger companies. This quickly builds initiative and leadership skills. Note that ownership can sometimes be hard to get early in your career.

* You can learn more how a company *operates*. At a startup, higher ups are usually one or two links away. You can see how executives operate on a day to day basis while also seeing other processes like legal/recruiting/marketing all at the same time. It's hard to describe, but its like drinking company concentrate, instead of a regular soup

* Startups are likely in SF

* You can wear different hats

* Compensation is usually very competitive, and rewards very hard work.

* Networking feels very authentic (within the company, not in SF)

Intern specific:

* You're a real employee. Your work is needed

* You have more freedom than a larger company. Like using the company card or being able to get some FT benefits.

Full time specific:

* Title inflation (depending how you look at it)

* So much freedom, so many casual events, and surrounded by younger people who like to work hard and get lit (sometimes).

## 3. Cons of a startup

As an intern:

* If its your junior year internship, it might be harder to get a full time big tech job if you decide you don't like startups and you're not coming from a big tech background. Key words: **it might be**. It's definitely doable.

* Less work life balance, but you're still an intern so like no one really expects you to be putting in crazy hours. (Although you might be inclined to sacrifice your own work life balance because you see people around you at the startup do the same as an intern. Beware, its a slippery slope.)

As a full time employee:

* Less work life balance
* Less job security
* Equity could be worth nothing

## 4. Startup vs big tech

* Startup org structure
* More ownership at a startup
* Less beauracracy at a startup
* More freedom at a startup
* More influence at a startup
* More work to be hard a startup
* Less work life balance overall

## 5. Getting into startups

* Networking
* The YC website
* Cold emailing
  * Probably a little note about how holistic background matters. Keep it real and how startup people are looking for driven people with interesting backgrounds.
* Events like greylock's techfair
* See starting your own

## 6. Starting your own startup

It's not about the idea... well it is... but its mainly how many times you can try an idea, fail, then try again.

## 7. Funding

TODO: Add more i can't think of anymore off the top of my head :(

* YC
* Pitt Innovation center


## 8. Startup lingo

Funding rounds

* Series A, B, C...
* Seed round, pre-seed round
* Options
* Runway
* Burn

## How Startups Differ from Traditional Internships

### Internship vs Startup Role

A traditional internship is typically structured with:
- Clear mentorship and learning objectives
- Defined projects with bounded scope
- Established processes and guidelines
- Time to learn without immediate pressure to deliver
- Rotation through different teams or projects

A startup, whether as an intern or full-time employee, is different:
- You're expected to contribute meaningfully from day one
- Projects are often undefined or constantly evolving
- You'll wear multiple hats and work across disciplines
- There's urgency—the company's survival may depend on your work
- Mentorship is often limited (founders and senior staff are stretched thin)
- You learn by doing, sometimes with limited guidance

**The upside:** You'll gain real-world experience, ship products, and see the direct impact of your work. You'll also develop problem-solving skills and independence faster than in a traditional internship.

**The downside:** You might feel overwhelmed, unsupported, or uncertain about whether you're on the right track. There's less structure and fewer safety nets.

## How Startups Differ from Big Tech

### The Big Tech Experience

At companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, or Amazon:
- Clear career progression and levels
- Established mentorship programs
- Well-defined projects with clear requirements
- Ample resources (tools, infrastructure, team support)
- Strong focus on code quality, testing, and best practices
- Collaborative code reviews and architectural discussions
- Stable compensation and benefits
- Learning from top engineers in the field

### The Startup Experience

Startups operate very differently:
- **Flat hierarchy:** You might report directly to the CTO or founder. Decision-making is faster but can be chaotic.
- **Undefined scope:** You might start working on feature X but pivot to feature Y mid-sprint. Flexibility is key.
- **Autonomy:** You have more independence but also more responsibility. There's less handholding.
- **Speed over perfection:** "Done" often trumps "perfect." You'll ship code before it feels ready.
- **Broader skill set:** You'll work on frontend, backend, DevOps, design, or even marketing—not just your specialty.
- **Limited resources:** You'll solve problems creatively with less infrastructure and fewer tools.
- **Direct impact:** Your work directly affects whether the company succeeds or fails. This can be motivating or stressful (often both).

### Comparison Table

| Aspect | Big Tech | Startup |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Career clarity | Clear levels and progression | Often unclear |
| Project definition | Well-defined | Evolving, sometimes undefined |
| Mentorship | Strong programs | Minimal, self-directed |
| Work-life balance | Varies, but generally manageable | Often long hours |
| Learning | Deep dives into specialties | Broad exposure to many areas |
| Stability | Very stable | Highly uncertain |
| Impact | Part of large systems | Direct, visible impact |
| Compensation | Very competitive | Often lower (but equity possible) |

## Why Work at a Startup?

### Reasons to consider a startup:

**1. Learning and Growth**
- You'll learn faster by doing more and solving diverse problems
- You'll understand how entire products and companies work, not just one component
- You'll gain skills in areas you didn't expect (product thinking, business acumen, cross-functional collaboration)

**2. Direct Impact**
- Your work matters. You can see the results of your coding in production within hours
- You're building something from the ground up, not maintaining legacy systems
- You can influence product direction and company decisions

**3. Equity**
- Many startups offer stock options or equity grants
- If the company succeeds, this can be extremely valuable
- It's a way to share in the company's upside

**4. Resume Building**
- Employers love to see early-stage startup experience
- It demonstrates resourcefulness, adaptability, and initiative
- You can claim credit for significant features or systems

**5. Network**
- Early-stage startups often have tight-knit teams that become lifelong networks
- You'll interact with founders, investors, and other entrepreneurs
- These relationships can lead to future opportunities

### Reasons to be cautious:

**1. Uncertainty**
- The company might fail. Startups have a high failure rate
- Your role and responsibilities might change constantly
- Job security is uncertain

**2. Burnout**
- Startup culture can glorify long hours and grinding
- You might be expected to do the work of 2-3 people
- Without clear boundaries, it's easy to overcommit

**3. Limited Learning Structure**
- You might learn bad practices if there's no one to mentor you
- You could miss out on deep technical knowledge in your specialty
- Without established best practices, you might form poor habits

**4. Compensation**
- Salary is often lower than big tech
- Equity might be worthless if the company fails
- Benefits are usually minimal

### How to Evaluate a Startup

Before committing, evaluate these factors:

**1. The Product**
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Who are the customers?
- Is there demand or traction?
- Can you get excited about it?

**2. The Team**
- What's the background of the founders? (Previous startups? Corporate experience?)
- Do they have a technical co-founder?
- Is the team passionate about the problem?
- Will you respect and learn from these people?

**3. Funding and Runway**
- How much money do they have? (This affects job security)
- How long can they operate with current burn rate?
- Have they raised from reputable investors?
- Is there a path to profitability or additional funding?

**4. Your Role**
- What will you actually be doing?
- Are responsibilities clear or very vague?
- Will you have mentorship or will you be learning on your own?
- Is the scope reasonable or are they expecting 5 people's work from you?

**5. Culture and Expectations**
- What's the expected work schedule?
- Do they value work-life balance or glorify grinding?
- What's the equity arrangement? (This matters for co-founders and early employees)
- Do their values align with yours?

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Founder(s) won't clearly explain the business model or go-to-market strategy
- Very high turnover among engineers
- Vague job descriptions and responsibilities
- Pressure to commit without learning details
- No clear technical leadership
- Founding team conflicts or dysfunction
- Unrealistic timelines or milestones
- "We'll figure it out as we go" with no plan whatsoever

## Tips for Success at a Startup

### 1. Be proactive
- Don't wait for directions. Identify problems and solve them
- Ask for feedback frequently
- Take initiative on tasks beyond your job description

### 2. Communicate clearly
- Over-communicate with your team
- Write things down (docs, Slack threads) because context is easy to lose
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear

### 3. Embrace change
- Plans will change. Projects will pivot. Get comfortable with it
- View it as a learning opportunity, not a frustration
- Be flexible in your role and responsibilities

### 4. Prioritize ruthlessly
- You can't do everything. Focus on what moves the needle
- Ask your manager/founder: "What's most important right now?"
- Say no to low-impact work

### 5. Document what you do
- Keep a record of your achievements and impact
- This will be valuable for future job applications or equity negotiations
- Helps the team understand what happened if people turn over

### 6. Set boundaries
- It's easy to work 60-hour weeks at a startup
- Be intentional about your work-life balance
- Burnout helps no one (especially not the startup)

### 7. Learn the business
- Understanding the market, customers, and business model makes you better at your job
- Ask founders about strategy and metrics
- Think about the product from a customer and business perspective
