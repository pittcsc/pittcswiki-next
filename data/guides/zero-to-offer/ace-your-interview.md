> This is a part of a series of guides called Zero to Offer aimed to help you navigate the internship process. We recommend you start [here](/guides/zero-to-offer/)!

Some time after applying, you might find a new email in your inbox titled along the lines of "Next Steps with..." 

Congrats! You've gotten an interview request! 

You may encounter several types of interviews across your internship search, but the most common formats are the technical, or coding, interview and the traditional behavioral interview. We've included our best strategies to tackle both below. 

## Coding Interviews
Coding Interviews are tough, but with the right practice you'll be able to pass them with ease. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before continuing, we recommend you read the following Tech Interview Handbook pages:

- [Coding Round Overview](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/software-engineering-interview-guide/) (5 minute read)
- [Picking a Language](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/programming-languages-for-coding-interviews/) (5 minute read)
- [Study and Practice](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) (5 minute read)

As well as our own [How To LeetCode guide](), which is a pre-requisite to this page's technical interview section. 

These pages should give you a solid idea of what to expect. But, just to be clear: 

### What Happens in a Coding Interview? 
A coding interview is typically a one-on-one phone or video call with an engineer where you will be given a (LeetCode-style in most cases, but not all) technical question. You will share your work through an online collaborative code editor (such as HackerRank, Coderpad, or CodePen). 

During the interview, you may be asked to:
- write your solution from scratch
- come up with your own test cases
- walk through your code or reasoning
- answer follow-up questions
- debug with or without running your code (depending on the platform)

And while many interviews are algorithmic, or "LeetCode-style," some companies may ask more practical engineering questions. For example, they may ask you to design a simple REST API, write SQL, or debug an existing snippet of code. When in doubt, always email your recruiter to ask what format to expect. 

### Knowledge is Key
Before you head into an interview, it's a good idea to practice some interview-style problems. LeetCode is a great way to practice these types of problems, but it only becomes effective once you build a solid foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms and a strong study strategy. 

Our [How To LeetCode guide]() will walk you through how to master LeetCode and turn the grind into real interview success. Please read through this before coming back here! 



OK, say you've become a LeetCode master. Surely this means you are guaranteed to pass every technical interview, right?

Well...

### Solving the Problem is Just Half the Battle
The other 50% of what you will be scored on during the interview is your ability to **understand the problem, articulate your solution, and explain your decision-making**. After all, not only is your interview evaluating you on your problem-solving skills, they are also assessing what it would be like to work with you on a team.

Because of that, you should aim to **think out loud** through the entire interview. 

#### Thinking Out Loud: Step-By-Step ####

**1. Think & Clarify**:
Before you write a single line of code, slow down and make sure you fully understand the problem. This is similar to some of the steps we've outlined in our How To LeetCode guide. 

- **a.** Read the question carefully and note down the inputs, outputs, and directions. 

- **b.** Clarify the wording and the constraints. Ask your interviewer questions like:
    - “Can the input be empty?”
    - “Can there be duplicate values?”
    - “When the problem says 'X,' does that mean to 'xyz'?" 
    
        This will help identify edge cases and ensure a correct understanding of the problem. 
    If you have no further questions but wish to know if you're thinking in the right direction, repeat the problem back in your own words. See if your interviewer corrects you on anything. 

- **c.** Make observations out loud. As you reason towards a solution, narrate your thoughts.

During this phase, your goal is to remove ambiguity and work towards an initial solution. 

**2. Explain Your Approach**:
Once the problem is clear and you've thought of a solution, take a moment to describe your approach simply in one or two sentences. Check in with your interviewer to see if it makes sense. Some candidates like to bullet point this summary down in comments or psuedocode as well. 

This step helps you catch any flaws in your idea and helps you avoid being lost in syntax down the line. It also gives the interviewer a chance to make clarifications and guide you if you’re headed in the wrong direction.

**3. Code**:
You should only start writing code once you've clarified and explained your plan. This part should be pretty smooth sailing, as you build out your solution from your notes. 

Write high-level comments and keep talking as you code. Mention what you're doing, and why. This keeps your implementation organized and ensures your interviewer is able to follow along. 

Watch out for overcomplication! If your code is becoming very long or convoluted, you might need to step back for a moment to ensure you are still on the right track. It is always recommended that you take the time to pause and course-correct, rather than veer confidently off course. 

**4. Review**:
Once you finish coding, your interviewer may allow you to execute your code. In some cases where execution is not allowed, you may have to dry run your code by walking through it line by line and simulating a small test case out loud. You may also be asked to identify and account for edge cases, such as empty or negative inputs. 

>[!NOTE]
> Note that a buggy solution does not equal a bad interview! This is a good place to showcase your debugging skills. If you get stuck, stay transparent. It's okay to admit if you're unsure of your mistake. Try to take it one step at a time, starting over with revising and explaining your thought process, coding, and reviewing. 

Finally, your interviewer may ask you to discuss trade-offs and time and space complexity. 

### Multi-Step/Object Oriented Interviews
Occasionally, you will encounter interviews that ask you to tackle a problem broken into two or more milestones. These interviews often ask you to design or extend a small system using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

In these interviews, you might begin by modeling a simple system, such as a shopping cart or a parking garage, using classes and relationships. After you implement this sytem, the interviewer will introduce new requirements, such as supporting additional item types or new behaviors. Each milestone builds on the previous one. 

You can approach these types of interviews similarly to LeetCode-style technicals, except with a emphasize on abstracting and reusing your code componenets. 

### Other Technical Interview Resources 
We highly recommend watching real interview videos as part of prep. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q_oYDQ2whs) is an example. 

Some companies publish their own guides or career blogs aimed at helping candidates succeed in technical interviews. For example, Pinterest has a web series [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od9zKkSlJYg&list=PL5zgfYmEpUaXOvlykos88DNFl9zU50UyB&index=2) where they share coding interview scenarios and strategies. Another great resource is [this](https://careersatdoordash.com/blog/technical-interview-preparation/) DoorDash blog, which contains some great tips. Your recruiter might also attach internal documents to your interview request that contain details specific for the company. 

In case you missed it in our [LeetCode guide](), [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/) and [the Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) are great places to start for new LeetCoders. 

## Behavioral Interviews
Knowing how to reverse a linked list and explaining it clearly is one thing, but being able to answer, “Which of our company’s values resonates most with you, and when have you demonstrated that in your past work?” is another. 

According to our favorite recruiter, more candidates fail the behavioral portion than the technical portion of interviews!

But, make no mistake. Behavioral interviews **aren't harder.** Candidates only fail them because they're underprepared for them. We've all made the mistake of assuming a behavioral interview was going to be easy, since it's "just talking about yourself." What actually happens is that the stress of a real interview, plus the lack of strong, coherant ideas prepared, leads to us fumbling our answers. 

We can easily avoid failing like this by knowing what to expect and preparing for it. 

### Prepping for Behavioral
Behavioral interview questions fall into two main types of questions: situational questions and values questions. 

Situtional questions often start with “Tell me about a time when…” or “Describe a situation where…”. These questions help interviewers understand how you think and act in real situations, navigate challenges, and communicate and work with others

Values questions are more broad and will assess your values, motivations, and passions, and wheter it aligns with the company's. 

This means that you should have two main strategies for answering behavioral questions: one for each type of question. 

### Situational Questions: The STAR Format
When interviewers ask these situational questions, they’re really asking for **evidence** that you have the certain soft skills they are looking for in a candidate. 

For example, if they ask you to tell them about a time when you had a conflict or had to compromise, they are looking for evidence that you have good conflict resolution skills. 

Therefore, to best tackle any situational question an interviewer hands you, you can distll the question into the "soft skill" it concerns like so and structure your answer in a way that best provides evidence of you showing that soft skill. 

To present your evidence, you will have to tell a linear story of that experience using the STAR format. 

**S** - **S**ituation: the background information, or the context behind this experience
**T** - **T**ask: the inciting incident; the problem/challenge you took responsibility for
**A** - **A**ction: the following cause-and-effect. What did you do to solve this problem? With what tools/people?
**R** - **R**esult: the resolution, including any resulting success, achievements, and learnings

#### STAR Format in Practice
When answering situational questions, one of the most common mistakes people make is jumping around in their narrative, resulting in a hard-to-follow answer. 

As an example: 
> **Q:** Tell me about a time when you had to adapt to an unexpected challenge.
>
> **A:** “Oh, I have an example when I had to cover a teammate’s responsibilities. So, we did actually finish the project on time, which was great. This was during my internship last summer. It was pretty stressful because they just left the team, and I didn’t really know their part at first, but I figured it out eventually. I was checking in with my manager a lot, too, to make sure I was on the right track. Anyway, I’m glad we got it done.” 

This answer lacks structure and specificity, which leads to it failing to showcase the interviewee's soft skills of adaptability, resourcefulness, and initiative (all qualities the question tries to get at).

If we label each part of the answer with what letter of STAR it corresponds to, we can see that it is all over the place. It doesn't fully satisfy/flesh out each component, either: 

> **A:** “**(S)** Oh, I have an example **(T)** when I had to cover a teammate’s responsibilities. **(R)** So, we did actually finish the project on time, which was great. **(S)** This was during my internship last summer. **(T)** It was pretty stressful because they just left the team, and I didn’t really know their part at first, **(A)** but I figured it out eventually. I was checking in with my manager a lot, too, to make sure I was on the right track. **(R)** Anyway, I’m glad we got it done.” 

If we answered this question in STAR format, making sure to flesh out each component to create a coherent story and address the soft skills raised by the question, we get a much better snippet: 

> **A:** “**(S)** During my internship last summer, I worked on a fullstack Flask project where a teammate unexpectedly left. **(T)** My job was to help cover their responsibilities, which included creating new endpoints to retrieve data from multiple recently-acquired data sources, and keep the project going. **(A)** Though I was new to fullstack development, I made sure to throughly study our existing documentation and met with engineers from the same team to better understand my new workflow. I also organized consistent check-ins with my manager to make sure I was on the right track. **(R)** By relying on both my instincts as a programmer, new learnings from my work, and guidance from seniors, I was able to pick up the job and finish the project. I learned the importance of taking initiative and thinking on my feet in times of turbulence, both of which I will take with me into my future work experiences.” 

#### Prepping like a STAR
We recommend preparing a few of these types of stories or work experiences to have in mind going into a behavioral interview. In a document, you can write these stories out in an annotated STAR format:

> Facing Technical Challenges: 
>
> - **S:** PNC internship last summer 
>
> - **T:** had to learn Java and Springboot + AI 
> 
> - **A:** I spent some time reading documentation, talking to team members, and scheduling meetings with my manager to ask questions. 
>
> - **R:** I built a fully functional project and became a helpful member that my team could rely on 

These notes are intentionally sparse. In the actual interview, you should not be reciting every story from memory. Rather, you should be able to adapt your story on the fly to best address the soft skills / core of the question being asked. But, having these bullet points will help you know what story beats to hit and help you highlight what you did/what actions you specifically took without worrying about losing your interviewer to the context of the situation. 

Some of the most common soft skills/abilities you will be asked to give evidence of include:
- Leadership 
- Teamwork 
- Handling conflict
- Problem-solving
- Identifying problems
- Communication
- Adaptability
- Resilience to failure
- Learning new things

TL;DR: Situational questions ask for evidence of soft skills. You must tell a linear story to signal/prove you have these soft skills. Stories are most effective in STAR format. 

### Values Questions
Questions that don't require an anacedote to answer are commonly used to assess your reasoning, values, and self-awareness. These might look like: 

- "Tell me about yourself."
- "What made you interested in this position at our company?"
- "Where do you see yourself in five years?"
- "What’s your greatest strength?"

With these questions, interviewers look for alignment between you and the company regarding your goals and mindset. 

There isn’t a one size fits all template to answer these types of questions like there is with the STAR format, but you can still prepare strong answers. Your goal in every answer is to signal at least two of three things:

1. 💻 You’re passionate about **your field** (software engineering)
You can draw on your past experiences or internships to show curiosity and excitement about building things, learning tech, and solving problems. 

2. 🏢 You’re genuinely interested in this **company/role/program…**
You are able to mention at least one specific aspect of this position that you are excited about. It can be something you picked up while researching the company or chatting with engineers in the recruiting process. 

3. 🚀 You’re passionate about **self-growth and improvement…**
Show that you are eager to learn and seek feedback, and that you understand how much you can gain from this experience. People, such as recruiters, hiring managers, etc., are more likely to give opportunities to those they believe will appreciate and benefit from it. 

To show these three elements in action, let’s look at a weak answer compared to a stronger one. 

> **Q:** What made you interested in our internship?
>
> **A:** “I just really want an internship to get more experience, and your company seems like a great place. I think it would help me build my skills, and I really need to get something on my resume.”

This answer doesn’t show passion for SWE, the company, or a growth mindset beyond “I need experience.” The modified answer below is much stronger and more compelling in comparison. 

> **A:** “💻 I love building things that people can actually use — it’s what excites me about SWE. 🏢 That’s why I was really drawn to Company XYZ, especially your focus on user accessibility. [more details here]. 🚀 I’m really excited to use this internship as an opportunity to learn more about user-friendly design and push myself to improve as a developer.” 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to note down your passions, what you like about SWE, and your career goals, and conduct thorough research on the company and its products, values, or culture before the interview. If your interview is virtual, you can have these notes on the side of your screen for easy reference. 

### A Side Tangent: Describing Technical Projects
You will likely be asked to talk about a technical project during the interview process, whether it's with a recruiter, engineer, or hiring manager. Some points to cover include: 

- What is the project? What is its function? 
- Where did the idea come from? What's the surronding context?
- If this is a team project, what was your role/specific involvement? What did you do by yourself and how did you coordinate with your teammates? 

If they ask more about the project or want a more technical overview, you can also talk about 
- High level project architecture (different layers of the project, frontend, backend, databases)
- Any design decisions you or your team made (technologies, frameworks chosens and why)

You can also describe the challenges you ran into and how you resolved them. Finally, conclude with your takeaways or new learnings

## Practice, Practice, Practice.
None of these interview knowledge, tips, and tricks would be effective without practice. 

Mock interviews for both behavioral and technical interviews are the best way to prep. They are the closest to a real interview experience and can help you assess your skills from a different person's point of view. PittCSC members who are verified in the discord can easily schedule mock interviews with other students or alumni through the #mock-interview channel. 

Besides doing mock interviews, you can also practice by yourself or in daily conversation. Talking aloud while LeetCoding or becoming a TA can help make explaining your problem-solving feel like second nature. Telling your friends, family, or other club members about your professional expriences or technical projects can help you feel more comfortable doing so in a real interview. 

It may feel very awkward at first, but you’ll improve tremendously. 

## Other Interview Formats
Technical/coding and behavioral interviews are the two main types of interviews you will encounter in your internship search. 

Other common formats/keywords include:
- **Recruiter Phone Screen:** A shorter behavioral call with the recruiter that will consist of a few easy questions and logistical details. 
- **Onsite:** Multiple interviews taking place in one day that are usually a mix of behavioral and technical. Onsites can be *Virtual Onsites* (taking place over video call) or real on-site interviews. 
- **System Design:** A type of technical interview that focuses on system architecture instead of programming. [Donne Martin's System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) is a great place to start. While it might seem completely different to coding technicals at first, know that a lot of the same principles of talking through your thought process, asking questions, and iterating on your solution apply here as well. 

## Your Turn to Ask Questions
At the end of every interview, you will have a chance to ask your interviewer some questions. We recommend always going in with at least one question in mind and being prepared to have a conversation. 

Example Questions: 
- What are the next steps of the hiring process? 
- What are you working on that excites you?
- What keeps you at (COMPANY)?
- What is your favorite thing about working at (COMPANY)?
- How is career development supported at (COMPANY)?
- How has the company evolved in recent years?

Keep in mind that this part of the interview is for you to learn whatever you need to know about the role and the company. You should prioritize asking about topics you’re actually curious about or things that might help you make a decision about this company if you were to get an offer.
