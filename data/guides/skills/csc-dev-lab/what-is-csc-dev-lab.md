So, you want to be a Software Engineer? Or maybe a PM, or a UI/UX designer? That's awesome.

You've probably heard the advice a million times: **"Just build projects."**

It's the golden rule of landing an internship. ["Zero to Offer"](/guides/zero-to-offer) says 100X times. Every person in industry will mention it. But let's be real for a second - it is _so much_ easier said than done.

## The "Just Build Projects" Trap

You sit down, open your IDE, and... blank stare.

- **"What do I even build?"** Clone Spotify? A To-Do list? It feels generic.
- **"How do I start?"** The tech stack is overwhelming. React, Next.js, Tailwind, databases... it's a lot to manage on top of your classes.
- **"I'm stuck."** You hit a bug, get frustrated and give up. It used to be that you'd spend 4 hours on Stack Overflow, and at least learn something. But now, you'd just copy-paste some AI code to make it work.

Did you really learn anything? Did you ship something real users will touch? Often, the answer is no. And that's okay! It's hard to simulate a real engineering environment by yourself in your dorm room.

## Bringing CS Back to CSC

For a long time, CSC has been incredible at career advice. We've mastered the art of the [resume](/guides/career/resume), the [behavioral interview](/guides/zero-to-offer/ace-your-interview), and [how to pass technicals](/guides/career/study-plan). But somewhere along the way, we drifted a bit from the core of it all: **Computer Science.**

We want to change that. We want to bring the focus back to building, creating, and engineering. We want to foster the next generation of:

- **Software Engineers** who write clean, scalable code.
- **UI/UX Designers** who craft intuitive and beautiful experiences.
- **Product Managers** who drive vision and execution.
- **DevOps Engineers** who keep the ship running smoothly.
- **and more**

## CSC Dev Lab

CSC Dev Lab is our answer to the "just build projects" struggle.

We aren't just throwing you into a hackathon, like [SteelHacks](/guides/skills/getting-started-with-x/hackathons#steelhacks), and wishing you luck. We are building a structured environment where you work in **real agile teams** on **real projects** that **real people** will use.

Think of it as your first internship, before your first internship.

### How it Works

1.  **Collaborative Growth:** You're never stuck alone. Your Team Lead and peers are there to debug with you, review your PRs, and help you level up your skills.
2.  **Real Tech Stacks:** We're building pretty cool projects (check out [Requests for Projects](/guides/skills/csc-dev-lab/requests-for-projects)). We choose modern tech stacks that are best for the project but also highly applicable to your next internship or job.
3.  **Actual Impact:** We're building software for the Pitt community and beyond. We hope this not only inspires you as a developer but also helps CSC emerge as the hub of the best engineers on campus.

### Why Join?

Because the best way to learn isn't by watching a tutorial; it's by doing. It's by breaking things, fixing them with your team, and seeing your work go live.

CSC Dev Lab is here to make you not just a better candidate, but a better engineer.
