The School of Computing and Information (SCI) has a dedicated Student Success team here to support you throughout your time at Pitt. They handle everything from course planning to helping you figure out what to do when you're stuck.

## About the Team

[Lynnsey Doane](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/lynnsey-doane) (Director) and [Kailyn Lukaszewski](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/kailyn-lukaszewski) (Coordinator) work with SCI students on academic stuff, but they also help with the non-academic parts of being a student. If you're trying to figure out your schedule, dealing with a rough semester, or just want to talk through something, they're available.

## Events

### Boba Bonanza

Midterms got you stressed? Student Success hosts Boba Bonanza around midterm season. Free boba, other SCI students, and a break from studying. It's pretty popular—worth checking out if you need a breather.

### Breakfast for Dinner

The Friday before finals week, they do Breakfast for Dinner. Pancakes, bacon, the works. It's basically a pre-finals hangout where you can grab food and, if you want, you can meet with TAs and professors to get ahead on studying.

## How to Reach Out

Everything is virtual, so you don't need to go anywhere.

## When to Use It

You don't have to be struggling to use Student Success. Some people reach out because they're doing well and want to do better. Others just want to talk through a decision or check in with someone. It's there for whatever you need.
