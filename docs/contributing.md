### Code Changes

1. Follow the existing code style (TypeScript, React best practices)
2. Ensure your code passes linting and formatting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint      # Check for linting errors
   npm run format:fix # Auto-format your code
   ```
3. Test your changes locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build     # Build for production
   npm run dev       # Run development server
   ```

## Pull Request Process

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - A clear title describing your changes
   - A description of what you added/changed and why
   - References to any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
3. **Wait for review** - The maintainers will review your PR and provide feedback

5. **Merge** - Once approved, your changes will be merged into main

## Guidelines
